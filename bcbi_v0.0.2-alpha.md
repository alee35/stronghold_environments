# `bcbi_v0.0.2-alpha`
--
This environment is a clone of the `bcbi_v0.0.1` environment. It was created to be updated when new requests arrive. As such, this environment ought to be considered potentially less robust than `bcbi_v0.0.1` or other non-alpha environments.

This environment has incorporated the following additions to the base `bcbi_v0.0.1 environment:

  - `conda install -c compbiocore/label/docker_build_v1 bcftools`
  - `conda install -c brown-data-science predictmd-texlive`
